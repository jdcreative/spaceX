        "descripcion": "God is calling this generation to take action! Many have heard this, but few have paid attention. But a different generation is rising up, one that does not hold back because of circumstances or depend on them either. A generation that is tired of seeing our world beaten by injustice, sadness, and hopelessness. A generation that is ready to be sent out and will not grow weary of saying, ¨send me!¨  God has sent out His word and ¨GO!¨ is our answer, and we know we are not alone. Let's join the millions that cry out ¨Here I am Lord, send me!¨  Starting today we join the GO Generation!",
